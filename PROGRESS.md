#### 1. Per-Participant Visibility Control
**Status:** Frontend Complete (Backend Integration Pending)

**Changes Made:**
- Added `visibility` field to `Participant` interface and `AddParticipantRequest` (`lib/api.ts`)
- Deprecated event-level visibility - host no longer controls everyone's privacy
- Each participant now controls their own location visibility independently

**Implementation Details:**
- Visibility toggle available when joining event
- Visibility can be updated anytime after joining
- Two modes: `'blur'` (fuzzy ~500m) or `'show'` (exact location)
- Host is just another participant with no special visibility privileges

**Files Modified:**
