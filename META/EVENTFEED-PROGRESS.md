## ‚úÖ Phase 2.7: Two Event Types System - COMPLETED

This phase adds support for two different types of events: **Fixed Location** and **Collaborative Location**. This allows the app to handle events where the organizer already knows the exact meeting place, as well as events where participants work together to find the best location.

#### 1. Type Definitions Updated
- [x] Added `LocationType = 'fixed' | 'collaborative'` type
- [x] Updated `EventStatus` to include 'cancelled' and 'completed'
- [x] Extended `Event` interface with location type fields:
  - `location_type: LocationType` - Type of event (required)
  - `fixed_venue_id?: string` - Google Place ID for fixed events
  - `fixed_venue_name?: string` - Venue name for fixed events
  - `fixed_venue_address?: string` - Full address for fixed events
  - `fixed_venue_lat?: number` - Venue latitude
  - `fixed_venue_lng?: number` - Venue longitude

**File:** `types/index.ts` lines 53, 77-82

#### 2. Post Event Modal Enhanced
- [x] Added location type selector with radio buttons
- [x] Two options with clear descriptions:
  - üó∫Ô∏è "Find Location Together" - for collaborative events
  - üìç "Fixed Location" - for events with predetermined venue
- [x] Conditional form fields based on selection:
  - **Collaborative**: Shows "General Area" input with info message
  - **Fixed**: Shows "Venue Name" (required) and "Address" (optional) inputs
- [x] Different helper text for each type
- [x] Validation updated to require correct fields per type
- [x] Form submission includes location_type and venue details

**Component:** `components/PostEventModal.tsx`

**Key Changes:**
- Lines 4, 17-21: Updated interface with location type fields
- Lines 38-41: Added state for location type and venue details

- Lines 93-95: Submit data includes location type fields
- Lines 191-294: Location type selector UI with conditional fields

#### 3. Event Card Display Updated
- [x] Different location display based on event type:
  - **Fixed events**: Shows `üìç [Venue Name]`
  - **Collaborative events**: Shows `üìç [Area] ¬∑ üó∫Ô∏è Finding location ¬∑ X venues`
- [x] "Finding location" text shown in blue to indicate active planning
- [x] Venue count displayed for collaborative events
- [x] Button text updated: "Join to Vote" for collaborative events, "Join" for fixed events

**Component:** `components/EventCard.tsx` lines 128-146, 265

#### 4. Meeting Location Card Component (NEW)
- [x] New component for displaying fixed location details

#### 5. Event Detail Page Conditional Rendering
- [x] Tab navigation conditionally shows "Find Meeting Point" only for collaborative events
- [x] Fixed events show only "Event Details" tab
- [x] Different content based on location type:
  - **Fixed**: Meeting Location section with MeetingLocationCard
  - **Collaborative**: Suggested Venues section with EventVenues component
- [x] Seamless user experience for both types

**File:** `app/event-detail/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Line 14: Imported MeetingLocationCard
- Lines 480-491: Conditional tab display

2. **No Real Voting**: Vote buttons update UI but don't persist
3. **No Real Join/Leave**: Join/Leave actions show toasts but don't persist
4. **Map View Placeholder**: Shows "Coming soon" message
5. **Planning Tab**: Limited for mock events (by design)

### Console Warnings (Minor)
1. Hydration warnings on date selector (suppressed with suppressHydrationWarning)
2. SSE connection errors for mock events (expected, handled gracefully)

### Browser Compatibility
- ‚úÖ Chrome/Edge (tested)
- ‚úÖ Safari (tested)
- ‚è≥ Firefox (not tested)
- ‚è≥ Mobile browsers (not tested)

---

## üìù Notes & Decisions

### Design Decisions
1. **Separate Routes**: `/event-detail` for feed-style view, `/event` for planning
2. **Mock Event Prefix**: Use `mock-` prefix to identify demo events
3. **Font Choice**: Afacad Flux for modern, clean aesthetic
4. **Progress Color**: Green instead of yellow for more positive vibe
5. **Image Hosting**: Unsplash for category placeholders
6. **Avatar Fallback**: Generate avatars with initials and colored backgrounds

### Technical Decisions
1. **Next.js 15**: App Router for modern React patterns
2. **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling
3. **TypeScript**: Strict typing for better DX
4. **Component Modularity**: Small, focused components
5. **Toast Notifications**: Sonner library for user feedback
6. **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component with remote patterns

### Future Considerations
1. Add animation/transition library (Framer Motion?)
2. Consider state management library for complex state (Redux/Zustand?)
3. Add form validation library (Zod + React Hook Form?)
4. Implement optimistic UI updates
5. Add skeleton loading states
6. Consider internationalization (i18n)
