Purpose: These six files define the project’s product scope, technical details, rules, progress, and pending work. Always cross-reference them when producing outputs or making updates.

PRODUCT.md – Product vision & scope: core features, use cases, target users, value proposition.
DESIGN.md – Technical blueprint: architecture, file structure, tech stack, APIs, deployment, integration details.
REGULATION.md – Development rules: coding standards, naming conventions, version control, testing requirements.
PROGRESS.md – Chronological project log: dated milestones, updates, and decisions.
TODO.md – Task tracker: dated actionable items, priorities, and statuses.
PRODUCT_FUTURE.md - This is a long-run, projected features for after we finished our current product goal and design. This is added along our development. Therefore, this should affect our immediate development of project unless speficically mentioned.
Rule:

Any new feature or change should be updated in all relevant META files (e.g., feature update → PRODUCT.md + DESIGN.md + PROGRESS.md + TODO.md).
