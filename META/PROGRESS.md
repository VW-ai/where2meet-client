# Project Progress

## 2025-10-10: Milestone 1 (M1) Completed

### ✅ M1-01: Input & Map
- Implemented smart auto-suggest search box:
  - Google Maps Autocomplete with real-time suggestions in `InputPanel.tsx`
  - Supports addresses, cities, landmarks, and businesses
  - Automatic field cleanup after selection
  - Event listener cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Click-to-add functionality on map
- Created interactive map visualization with Google Maps JavaScript API
- Added delete functionality for all entered locations
- UI built with Tailwind CSS and responsive design
- **Note**: Removed manual lat/lng input as per user requirement - auto-suggest only

### ✅ M1-02: Center Calculation (Centroid)
- Implemented spherical centroid algorithm in `lib/algorithms.ts:30`
  - Converts lat/lng to 3D unit vectors
  - Averages vectors and normalizes back to coordinates
  - Handles edge cases (poles, 180° meridian)
- Real-time center marker (green) updates on map as locations change
- Display centroid coordinates in Analysis Info section

### ✅ M1-03: Minimum Enclosing Circle (MEC)
- Implemented Welzl's algorithm in `lib/algorithms.ts:153`
  - Expected O(n) time complexity
  - Handles degenerate cases (duplicates, collinear points, 1/2/3 points)
- Blue circle overlay visualizes MEC on map
- Circle expands by 10% (epsilon) for POI search radius
- Display circle radius in Analysis Info section

### ✅ M1-04: In-circle POI Search
- Integrated Google Maps Places Library (nearbySearch)
- Keyword-based search within expanded MEC
- Client-side de-duplication by `place_id`
- Basic filtering:
  - Minimum rating threshold (3.0)
  - Distance calculation from center
  - Open/closed status
- Search implemented in `app/page.tsx:107`

### ✅ M1-05: Candidate List & Ranking
- Comprehensive candidate display in `CandidatesPanel.tsx`:
  - Name, address, rating, user ratings count
  - Distance from center (km)
  - Opening hours status (Open Now / Closed)
- Dual sorting modes:
  - **Rating-first**: Higher rated venues prioritized
  - **Distance-first**: Closer venues prioritized
- Interactive selection:
  - Click candidate in list to highlight on map (red marker)
  - Hover effects and visual feedback
- Orange markers for all candidates, red for selected

### ✅ M1-06: Route Travel Time
- "View on Maps" button for each venue
- Deeplink to Google Maps with route planning
- Format: `https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query={lat},{lng}&query_place_id={placeId}`
- Opens in new tab for directions

### ✅ Error Handling & Graceful Degradation
- API key validation with helpful error message
- Empty state handling for all lists
- Try-catch blocks for Places API calls
- User feedback for search failures
- localStorage persistence for entered locations
- Minimum radius (100m) for single-point MEC

### Technical Implementation
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router) with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v3
- **Maps**: @vis.gl/react-google-maps (1.5.5)
- **Algorithms**: Pure TypeScript in `lib/algorithms.ts`
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useCallback, useEffect)
- **Data Persistence**: Browser localStorage
- **Build System**: Successfully builds and type-checks

### Files Created
```
app/
  page.tsx              # Main application with state management
  layout.tsx            # Root layout
  globals.css           # Global styles with Tailwind
components/
  MapView.tsx           # Google Maps integration
  InputPanel.tsx        # Location input controls
  CandidatesPanel.tsx   # Venue search & list
lib/
  algorithms.ts         # Centroid, MEC, distance calculations
types/
  index.ts              # TypeScript type definitions
```

### Deliverables
✅ Single-page demo (http://localhost:3000)
✅ Full flow: addresses → centroid → MEC → POI search → candidates
✅ Local session storage for persistence
✅ Production build ready (`pnpm build` successful)

### Next Steps (M2)
Per `TODO.md`, next milestone focuses on:
- Server-side implementation with FastAPI
- Multi-user event creation and joining
- Real-time updates via SSE
- PostgreSQL persistence
- Redis caching
