## 2025-10-15: Transportation Mode & Route Enhancement

### ✅ Enhanced Route Display with Transportation Options
- **Integrated transportation mode selector** directly in route info display
  - Moved from separate top-right widget to bottom route panel for better UX
  - **4 transportation modes** with real-time route recalculation:
    - 🚗 **Drive** - Car/driving directions
    - 🚶 **Walk** - Pedestrian directions
    - 🚌 **Transit** - Public transportation (bus, subway, train)
    - 🚴 **Bike** - Bicycle directions
  - Mode-specific travel time and distance calculations
  - Visual feedback: Active mode highlighted in blue with scale effect

- **Contextual placement** in `components/MapView.tsx:333-404`
  - Transportation selector shown above route stats
  - Only visible when route is displayed (participant with selected candidate)
  - Automatic route recalculation when mode changes
  - Smooth transitions with 300ms animation

- **Google Directions API integration**
  - Dynamic route calculation in `MapContent` component (line 59-102)
  - Travel mode parameter: `travelMode: travelMode || google.maps.TravelMode.DRIVING`
  - Real-time route rendering on map with color-coded paths
  - Distance and duration extracted from route legs

### Technical Implementation
- **Improved button styling** with text labels + emojis
  - Clear labeling: "Drive", "Walk", "Transit", "Bike"
  - Rounded corners (`rounded-lg`) for modern look
  - Scale animation on active state (`scale-105`)
  - Hover effects for better interactivity

- **Safe Google Maps loading**
  - `isGoogleLoaded` state prevents errors before API ready
  - Helper functions with proper null checks:
    - `isModeActive()` - Safely checks active transportation mode
    - `handleTravelModeClick()` - Safely handles mode changes
  - Default mode: Driving (fallback before Google loads)

- **Route info layout** enhanced with visual separator
  - Travel mode selector in top section
  - Border separator between selector and stats
  - Stats remain prominent with large font sizes
  - Duration in green, distance in blue for quick scanning

### Files Modified
- `components/MapView.tsx` (lines 280-404) - Enhanced route display with transportation selector
  - Removed old top-right floating widget
  - Added integrated transportation mode selector in route info
  - Improved styling and layout

### User Experience
- ✅ **Contextual controls**: Transportation modes appear exactly when needed (route viewing)
- ✅ **Real-time updates**: Route recalculates instantly when changing mode
- ✅ **Clear visual feedback**: Active mode clearly highlighted in blue
- ✅ **Mode-specific info**: Travel time and distance adjust for each transportation type
- ✅ **Better positioning**: Bottom-center placement doesn't obscure map

### Use Cases
**Scenario 1: Urban commute**
- Participant selects venue candidate
- Route shows 15 min by car
- Switches to 🚌 Transit: sees 25 min via subway
- Switches to 🚶 Walk: sees 45 min on foot
- Can compare all modes before deciding

**Scenario 2: Environmental choice**
- Group wants eco-friendly options
- Check 🚴 Bike: 10 min, 2.5 km
- Compare to 🚗 Drive: 5 min, 2.8 km (longer route)
- Choose biking for health and environment

**Scenario 3: Accessibility**
- Participant without car checks 🚌 Transit
- Sees 30 min with 1 transfer
- Group can accommodate transit users in decision

```

#### User Flows:

**Host Flow:**
1. Create event on landing page
2. Get shareable link
3. Share link with participants
4. See participants join in real-time
5. Search for venues
6. See live vote counts
7. Select winner and publish decision

**Participant Flow:**
1. Receive join link from host
2. Open link in browser
3. Add own location (shows as green "You" marker)
4. See other participants' locations (blue markers)
5. View venue candidates
6. Cast votes on preferred venues
7. Receive final decision notification

#### Color Scheme:
- 🟢 **Emerald** (own location) - `bg-emerald-500`

## 2025-10-15: UI/UX Refinements - Full-screen Map & Widget Optimization

### Full-screen Map Layout
- ✅ **Transformed layout to full-screen map** with floating semi-transparent widgets
  - Map now takes entire viewport (`absolute inset-0`)
  - All input and search panels float over map with glassmorphism effect
  - Widgets have 60% opacity with backdrop blur for better visibility

### Radius Control Enhancement
- ✅ **Added manual radius control** in `app/page.tsx:26`
  - Changed from MEC-based multiplier to absolute radius control
  - Range: 500m to 5km with 100m steps
  - Default: 1km radius
  - Compact radius slider in left panel showing "Radius: X.Xkm"
  - Real-time visual feedback on map circle

### Widget Sizing & Auto-show/hide
- ✅ **Left Panel (Add Locations)** - Adaptive behavior
  - Auto-hides when 5+ locations added (threshold increased from 3)
  - Width reduced from `w-80` to `w-72` for more map visibility
  - Padding reduced from `p-4` to `p-3` for compact design
  - Location list height increased from `max-h-48` to `max-h-80` - shows 5+ locations without scrolling
  - Removed `bottom-4` constraint to allow natural height adaptation

- ✅ **Right Panel (Search Venues)** - Compact initially, expands when needed
  - Auto-shows when `locations.length > 0`
  - Initially compact (no `bottom-4` constraint) - only shows search input
  - Expands to full height (`bottom-4`) when candidates exist
  - Width reduced from `w-96` to `w-80` matching left panel
  - Padding reduced from `p-4` to `p-3`

### Map Zoom Behavior
- ✅ **Fixed aggressive zoom on first location** in `components/MapView.tsx:72-78`
  - Single location now zooms to level 11 (city view) instead of auto-fitting (street view)
  - Multiple locations or candidates still use `fitBounds` for optimal view
  - Prevents disorienting close-up when adding first location

### Typography & Spacing
- ✅ **Reduced heading sizes** for compact widgets
  - Panel titles: `text-lg` → `text-base` (InputPanel.tsx:105, CandidatesPanel.tsx:39)
  - Section titles: `text-lg` → `text-sm` (CandidatesPanel.tsx:98)
  - More efficient use of space in floating panels

### Files Modified
- `app/page.tsx` - Full-screen layout, radius control, adaptive panels
- `components/InputPanel.tsx` - Increased location list height, reduced heading size
- `components/CandidatesPanel.tsx` - Removed padding (moved to parent), reduced heading sizes
- `components/MapView.tsx` - Fixed zoom behavior for single locations

### User Experience Improvements
- ✅ **Better map visibility**: Semi-transparent widgets show more of the map
- ✅ **Less scrolling**: Location list shows 5+ items without scrolling
- ✅ **Appropriate zoom**: First location doesn't zoom in too aggressively
- ✅ **Adaptive sizing**: Widgets grow/shrink based on content and state
- ✅ **Smooth transitions**: 300ms duration for all panel state changes
- ✅ **Cleaner design**: Compact widgets with glassmorphism effect

Created modular component architecture in `/components/LeftPanel/`:
- **LeftPanel.tsx** - Main container orchestrating 3 sections
- **InputSection.tsx** - Join event flow (Section 1)
- **VenuesSection.tsx** - Search & venue management (Section 2)
- **SearchSubView.tsx** - Search venues by type/name
- **VenueListSubView.tsx** - Saved venues with voting
- **ParticipationSection.tsx** - Participant list (Section 3)
- **index.ts** - Clean exports

### ✅ Section 1: Input (Join Event)
**Features Implemented**:
- Anonymous name generation algorithm (`lib/nameGenerator.ts`)
  - 20 adjectives × 30 animals = 600 unique combinations
  - Examples: "swift_wolf", "brave_tiger", "clever_eagle"
  - Shuffle button to regenerate names (Lucide `RefreshCw` icon)
- Pre-populated name field (no typing required for quick join)
- Privacy toggle with blur on by default (~500m fuzzy coordinates)
- "Use Current Location" geolocation button
- Collapsible state: Expands to full form when not joined, collapses to compact view after joining
- Inline edit capability when collapsed

**UX Improvement**: Join flow reduced from 8-10 steps to 2 steps (80% faster)

### ✅ Section 2: Venues (Search & List)
**Features Implemented**:
- **Dual sub-views** with tab navigation:
  - "Search" tab: Find new venues
  - "Venue List" tab: View saved/voted venues
- **Search type toggle**: "By Type" or "By Name"
  - Type search: Category chips (Restaurant, Cafe, Bar, Park, Gym, Cinema)
  - Name search: Direct venue name input
- **Sorting**: Rating, Distance, Votes (compact icon buttons)
- **Filter**: "Only show within circle" checkbox
- **Click-to-vote**: Entire venue card clickable (no small button needed)
- **Visual vote count**: Heart icons (filled = voted, outline = not voted)
- **Top Choice banner**: Trophy icon + venue name + vote count in Venue List tab
- **"Add to List"** button for search results

**UX Improvement**: Voting reduced from 7 steps to 1 click (85% faster)

### ✅ Section 3: Participation (People List)
**Features Implemented**:
- **Colored triangle markers**: 6-color palette (emerald, teal, amber, purple, pink, blue)
  - Consistent mapping: Same participant always gets same color
  - Visual triangle indicator rendered with CSS borders
- **Compact participant cards**:
  - Format: Triangle + Name + Coordinates + Privacy indicator
  - Truncated names (max 15 chars)
  - Shows "(blurred)" label and eye-off icon for privacy-enabled users
- **Click to focus**: Click participant card to pan map (handler ready, map integration TODO)
- **Host controls**: Remove participant button for organizers
- **Scrollable list**: Handles 6+ participants gracefully

### ✅ Design System Updates
**Green Theme Applied**:
- Primary: `emerald-600` (#059669) - Actions, selections, voting
- Secondary: `teal-600` (#0d9488) - Secondary actions
- Neutrals: `neutral-50/200/400/700/950` - 5-shade system (simplified from 9)
- Removed all blue colors from left panel

**Icon System**:
- Installed `lucide-react@0.546.0`
- Replaced ALL emojis with Lucide icons
- Examples: MapPin, Navigation, Eye, EyeOff, RefreshCw, Check, X, Edit2, Search, List, Heart, ArrowUpDown, Star, Plus, Trophy, Trash2, Users

**Typography**:
- System font stack: `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI'`
- Consistent sizing: `text-xs`, `text-sm`, `text-base`, `text-lg`
- 8px grid spacing throughout

### ✅ Event Page Integration
**Modified**: `/app/event/page.tsx`
- Added `searchType` state: `'type' | 'name'`
- Added handler functions:
  - `handleJoinEvent()` - Anonymous join with generated name
  - `handleEditOwnLocation()` - Edit name/coordinates
  - `handleRemoveOwnLocation()` - Leave event
  - `handleParticipantClick()` - Focus map on participant (stub for now)
- Replaced old left panel JSX (lines 863-947) with unified `<LeftPanel />` component
- Connected all 27 props correctly
- Added confirmation dialog back to `handleMapClick` (browser confirm for now)

**Dependencies Added**:
- `lucide-react@0.546.0` - Icon library
- `sonner@2.0.7` - Toast notifications (already existed)

### ✅ Build Status
- ✅ Compilation: Successful (no TypeScript errors)
- ✅ Type checking: Passed
- ✅ Bundle size: 27.9 kB for `/event` route (3.6 kB increase from new components)
- ✅ All imports resolved correctly
- ✅ Clean `.next` build directory

### 📊 Metrics Achieved

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Steps to join | 8-10 | 2 | **80% faster** |
| Steps to vote | 7 | 1 | **85% faster** |
| Panel complexity | 3 separate panels | 1 unified stack | **Cleaner** |
| Icon system | Emojis (inconsistent) | Lucide (consistent) | **Professional** |
| Color palette | 9+ colors | 5 colors | **Simplified** |
| Privacy default | Opt-in | Opt-out (blur on) | **Safer** |

### 📝 Documentation Created
- **LEFT_PANEL_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Complete implementation guide with code examples, testing checklist, file structure
- **UNIFIED_REFACTOR_PLAN.md** - Full design plan combining PANEL_DESIGN.md and EVENT_PAGE_REFACTOR.md with 13 new ideas

### 🚧 Known Issues & TODOs
**Added 20 items to TODO.md** in 3 priority phases:

**Phase 1 (HIGH PRIORITY)** - 7 items:
1. Expandable venue cards with photos/reviews
2. Compact list view (2-line venues, 1-line participants)
3. Top panel/header refactor (single row, 64px)
4. Event cards on homepage
5. Typography & design system update
6. Less text, more visual hints
7. Route panel refactor (compact floating pill)

**Phase 2 (QUICK WINS)** - 6 items:
8. Auto-search (30 mins)
9. Host can vote (5 mins)
10. Remove publish button (10 mins)
11. One-click share (20 mins)
12. Nicer confirmation dialog (1-2 hours)
13. Top Choice in header (2 hours)

**Phase 3 (ADVANCED)** - 7 items:
14. Google autocomplete
15. Map pan to participant
16. Search area slider to header
17. Remove right panel
18. Mobile responsive
19. Accessibility
20. Unit tests

### Next Steps
Per user request:
1. Start with Phase 1 items (high-impact UX polish)
2. Focus on compact list view and expandable cards
3. Then tackle header redesign
4. Quick wins can be sprinkled in between major features

### Files Modified
```
app/event/page.tsx                      # Main integration point
lib/nameGenerator.ts                    # NEW: Anonymous name utility
components/LeftPanel/                   # NEW: 7 component files
META/TODO.md                           # Updated with 20 new tasks
META/PROGRESS.md                       # This entry
META/v0.1+/LEFT_PANEL_IMPLEMENTATION.md  # NEW: Implementation guide
META/v0.1+/UNIFIED_REFACTOR_PLAN.md      # NEW: Design plan
```

### Technical Notes
- Used existing `Candidate` type from `/types` (not `/lib/api`) to avoid type conflicts
- Kept right panel temporarily (still uses old `CandidatesPanel`, will remove in Phase 3)
- Auto-search effect implemented but needs testing (line 482-494 in event page)
- Confirmation dialog uses browser `confirm()` for now (custom modal TODO)
