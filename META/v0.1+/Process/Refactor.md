# Goal
We will do a partially refactor of our application, focusing on three aspects:
## 1. UIUX
Our goal is to completely refactor frontend (creating a new one, not using the exsting one at all), preserving the functionality, with a more cohesive frontend design, and some functionality upadtes.
The design of the new UIUX of the website will focuses on the following aspects:
1. Straight forward interaction, user knows what the application does in the first sight.
2. Well Designed Application Language
3. all the components/view will be mobile-adapative.
## 2. Better DevOps Procedure:
As we implement the new frontend, we will be creating unit testing as we progresses for the codebase.
## 3. Added Feature
We will be adding small features on top of what we have to make the whole experience for cohesive and natural.
1. clicking location on map would provide a card containing the overview info like pictures, reviews stars, opening hour, websites, and some commnets, e.g.
2. do not show coordinates for participants if not in the privacy mode (each user turned his/her own privacy mode), but 
3. the host can selectively give participant host privelege.
