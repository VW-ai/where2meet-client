    - Compute the **Minimum Enclosing Circle**; visualize center and radius.
- [x]  **M1-04 In-circle POI Search (by keyword)** âœ…
    - Within the MEC (or MEC Ã— (1+Îµ)), use the Maps SDK (local key) to search by keyword (e.g., *basketball court*).
    - Do client-side de-duplication and basic filtering (open now / rating / distance).
- [x]  **M1-05 Candidate List & Ranking** âœ…
    - Show **candidate venues** list and map markers; support **rating-first** / **distance-first** sorting.

- [x]  **Typography & Spacing** âœ…
    - Reduced heading sizes for compact design
    - Adaptive auto-show/hide based on content
